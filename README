A small ruby program used for parsing copy documents, and putting the content into a CSV file to be uploaded. Used for a DAC Propietary platform. http://www.dacgroup.com/page-torrent.htm

Requires ruby 1.9.1 or greater to run. 
For Mac OSX and Linux, I recommend rvm: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

One installed, either download the source, or use git to grab it. Open up command prompt/terminal, browse to the directory and run using:

parse_copy

You may need to update the parse_copy file's shebang to point to your installation of ruby.

Then enter in paths to the text files, separated by semicolons. Example:
dumpsters.txt;recycling.txt;garbage-pickup.txt. Or you can tell it to read all text files in the current directory by typing: *.txt
